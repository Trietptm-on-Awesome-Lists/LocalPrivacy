### What is this?

This is a list of things you can do to improve your computer's security and your own privacy. Please feel free to ask questions about any of them!

### Wow, this is long! What should I do first?

These are my top recommendations:

* Laptops and desktops: Install [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) and [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) in your favorite web browser
*  All web browsers, including mobile: [Change your default search engine away from Google](https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/chrome-firefox-edge-internet-explorer-change-default-search-engine-11364117803672). Also, [minimize Google's tracking](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
*   [Maximize your privacy on social media](https://www.uc.edu/infosec/info/SocialMediaPrivacySettings.html)

### Overall guides and tools

These are terrific walk-throughs that will protect you from the commonest and most damaging privacy and security problems.

*   [Lock Down Your Digital Identity](http://femtechnet.org/csov/lock-down-your-digital-identity/)

## EVERYWHERE

### Laptops, mobile, social media: Turning off geolocation

The more you allow your devices and social media to geolocate you, the more extensive, accurate, and hackable/leakable a picture can be created of your habits.

* [Snapchat](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-snapchat-snap-maps/)

### Password managers you can install

A password manager is what it sounds like: it creates and remembers hard-to-crack passwords so you don't have to! For many people, choosing bad passwords is their easiest-to-exploit security vulnerability. Most password managers can sync passwords among your devices.

*   [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) (freemium, pro version quite inexpensive)
*   [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) (free/open source)
*   [1Password](https://1password.com/) (pay)

## LAPTOP OR DESKTOP COMPUTER

### Hard-disk encryption

Encrypting your hard disk means that if your computer is stolen or lost, whoever ends up with it next cannot see your data.

*   Mac: [Setting up FileVault](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25553?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)
*   Windows: [Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/234826/how-to-enable-full-disk-encryption-on-windows-10/), [Windows 8](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-includes-seamless-automatic-disk-encryption-if-your-pc-supports-it/), [Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835565(v=ws.10).aspx)
*   Linux: try [TrueCrypt](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33255/how-to-secure-your-linux-pc-by-encrypting-your-hard-drive/)

### Disabling sharing and unnecessary communications protocols

In general, if you're not using a particular communications protocol, turning it off is wise. Doing so reduces the number of ways your computer can be hacked.

*   Windows: [Windows 10](http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/a-guide-to-windows-10-security-settings/), [Windows 8](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-tips-managing-security-windows-8-1/)

### Setting up WiscVPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) keeps your online activity from being snooped on by random outsiders. This is **especially** important when you are using public wifi, as at a coffeeshop or airport. UW-Madison's WiscVPN is free for students, faculty, and staff to use.

N.b.: Campus changed its WiscVPN infrastructure during summer 2017. The links below take you to updated content.

*   Mac: [Connecting through Native VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=12534)
*   Windows: [WiscVPN AnyConnect client](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=11997) (for connection type, choose IP-pool-OffCampus)
* Linux: [AnyConnect](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=9120)
*   [VPNs for Beginners](https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/38176/vpns-beginners-need-know/) (technical, but clearly explained)

### The Onion Router (TOR)

Tor disguises your Internet traffic and disassociates you from it by concealing your IP address. The Tor Browser is Firefox + Tor, and is desktop/laptop cross-platform. Orbot is for Android phones and tablets. The Tails operating system is an OS-on-a-stick that you can take with you and use on computers you might not otherwise trust.

*   [Tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org/)

## BROWSER SETTINGS AND PLUGINS

### Browser (computer): Security-related settings

*   [Firefox](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039455/five-steps-to-ultimate-firefox-security.html)
*   [Chrome](https://ajarr.org/home/security-recommendations/item/57-google-chrome-browser-settings)

### Browser (computer): Security/privacy plugins

Web trackers and advertising networks are a major source of privacy leakage; ad networks increasingly contain malware. Every browser should install Privacy Badger and HTTPS Everywhere at minimum.

*   [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
*   [Privacy Badger!](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
*   [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation)

*   [5 security tools for Windows Phone](https://blog.kaspersky.com/windows-8-security-apps/4881/)

### Browser (computer and mobile): Changing default search engine away from Google

Google tracks you and your search history. DuckDuckGo does not. Use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine.

*   [Instructions for most browsers](https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/chrome-firefox-edge-internet-explorer-change-default-search-engine-11364117803672)
*   Alternately, go to [DuckDuckGo's home page](https://duckduckgo.com/) and see if DDG prompts you to change your default search engine.
