### What is this?

This is a list of things you can do to improve your computer's security and your own privacy. Please feel free to ask questions about any of them!

### Computer: hard-disk encryption

Encrypting your hard disk means that if your computer is stolen or lost, whoever ends up with it next cannot see your data.

*   Mac: [Setting up FileVault](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25553?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)
*   Windows: [Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/234826/how-to-enable-full-disk-encryption-on-windows-10/), [Windows 8](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-includes-seamless-automatic-disk-encryption-if-your-pc-supports-it/), [Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835565(v=ws.10).aspx)
*   Linux: try [TrueCrypt](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33255/how-to-secure-your-linux-pc-by-encrypting-your-hard-drive/)

### Computer: disabling sharing and unnecessary communications protocols

In general, if you're not using a particular communications protocol, turning it off is wise. Doing so reduces the number of ways your computer can be hacked.

### Computer: Setting up WiscVPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) keeps your online activity from being snooped on by random outsiders. This is **especially** important when you are using public wifi, as at a coffeeshop or airport. UW-Madison's WiscVPN is free for students, faculty, and staff to use.

*   Mac: [Connecting through Native VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=12380)
*   Windows: [WiscVPN AnyConnect client](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=11997) (for connection type, choose IP-pool-OffCampus)

### Password managers you can install

A password manager is what it sounds like: it creates and remembers hard-to-crack passwords so you don't have to! For many people, choosing bad passwords is their easiest-to-exploit security vulnerability.

*   [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) (freemium, pro version quite inexpensive)
*   [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) (free/open source)
*   [1Password](https://1password.com/) (pay)

### Browser (computer): Security-related settings

*   [Firefox](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039455/five-steps-to-ultimate-firefox-security.html)
*   [Chrome](https://ajarr.org/home/security-recommendations/item/57-google-chrome-browser-settings)

### Browser (computer): Security/privacy plugins

Web trackers and advertising networks are a major source of privacy leakage; ad networks increasingly contain malware. Every browser should install Privacy Badger at minimum.

*   [Privacy Badger!](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
*   [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation)
*   [More suggestions (cross-browser)](http://skytechgeek.com/2016/12/5-must-have-privacy-add-ons-for-your-browser/)
*   [Chrome Store plugins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/privacy)

### Browser (computer and mobile): Changing default search engine away from Google

Google tracks you and your search history. DuckDuckGo does not. Use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine.

*   [Instructions for most browsers](https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/chrome-firefox-edge-internet-explorer-change-default-search-engine-11364117803672)
*   Alternately, go to [DuckDuckGo's home page](https://duckduckgo.com/) and see if they prompt you to change your default browser.

### Browser (mobile): Security/privacy plugins

*   [Safari on iOS](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/01/14/safari-privacy-iphone-ipad/)
*   [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/focus-by-firefox-content-blocking/id1055677337?mt=8) (browser and/or Safari ad/tracking blocker)
*   [Firefox (any platform)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/)
